The users are strongly suggested that they generate the lmdb datasets
by themselves using the codes provided in ../data_preparation/. This
is because the sizes of the datasets used in our experiments are
extraordinary large. 

For example, the size of one single "basic500k_cover_stego40_train"
dataset is 115 gigabytes while the size of the largest
"basic5000k_cover_stego40_train" is 1.5 terabytes!

However, we can provide the FTP site to the users who can not generate
the lmdb dataset by themselves to download the training/testing
datasets. Just send a request mail to tansq@szu.edu.cn.
