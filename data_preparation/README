The JPEG images should be decompressed to their corresponding
floating-point spatial representations firstly before they are fed
into our proposed framework.

For example, ./originals/cover/n00440382_15706.jpg is decompressed to
./spatial_representations/cover/n00440382_15170.spatial.

./create_dataset.py reads in each cover spatial representation and its
corresponding stego spatial representation in pair to generate the
resulting lmdb dataset.

PLEASE NOTE that due to some authorization issues, the program to
decompress the JPEG images to their corresponding spatial
representations can not be provided here. phill salee's jpeg toolbox
is a good alternative.
